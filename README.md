# EducationFunding.UK

Welcome to the repo - this site is for cataloguing resources published by government agencies (principally the ESFA, but others as well), for use by education and training providers.

It's better than browser bookmarks! Mostly.

It's also a place to share useful resources between MIS staff, so if you have a handy tool or spreadsheet, we can host it for you.
