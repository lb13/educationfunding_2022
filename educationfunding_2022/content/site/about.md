Title: About the site

If you work in the UK education sector, particularly if you are involved in funding or data management, you will probably have struggled (at one time or another) with understanding how UK education funding works.

My own experience, working in the MIS team of a Further Education college, was initially quite overwhelming because there was no simple, straightforward way to access and digest all the information that was out there.

After several years, I had built up some bookmarks in my browser, and written a bunch of notes - but it was getting difficult to keep the growing list of resources organised, and sharing them with colleagues wasn't easy either.

In the end, I created this website as a way to catalogue as many online resources as I could, and make them as easy as possible to find.

Hope it helps!
