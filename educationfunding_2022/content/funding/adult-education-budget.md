The Adult Education Budget is split into two funding methods: Adult Skills and Community Learning.

**Adult Skills** is qualification-based funding that depends on the size and type of qualification being studied (as well a number of eligibility requirements for the learner).

**Community Learning** is a fixed allocation that can be spent by training providers in the education and support of disadvantaged learners, or in subject areas not covered by regulated qualifications.

Adult Skills is further broken down into a number of funding offers or initiatives that can provide targeted funding to particular groups.

In 2022/23, examples include:

* English and Maths Legal Entitlement
* Digital Skills Legal Entitlement
* Level 2 Legal Entitlement
* Level 3 Legal Entitlement
* Free Courses for Jobs
