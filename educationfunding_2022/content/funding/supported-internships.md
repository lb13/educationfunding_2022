Supported Internships (SIs) are a work-based study programme for 16 to 24 year olds with SEND who have an education health and care (EHC) plan, who want to move into employment and who need extra support to do so. SIs are designed to equip young people with the skills they need to secure and sustain employment through learning in the workplace.
