Technically part of the Adult Education Budget, these are bundles of training and work experiences that lead to a guaranteed interview (although not necessarily a job!) with a local employer.

Learners must be in receipt of JSA, ESA, or Universal Credit, and must be referred by the DWP (i.e. a local Job Centre). There is some flexibility for the training provider to proactively recruit eligible learners and get the DWP to retrospectively make a referral.
