Title: 14-16 Funding
TargetTag: "14-16 funding"

Colleges are able to claim direct funding for learners who are aged 14 or 15 on 31st August if they are studying full time with the provider.

There are additional requirements and responsibilities for this sort of provision, and although the national curriuculum does not have to be delivered, it does need to be 'broad and balanced', covering essentials like English, Maths, and Science, as well as religious education and relationships / sex.

The funding mechanism for this direct funding follows the 16-18 model, but the learners must be correctly flagged in the ILR using an LDM code.

Independent of this direct funding, colleges and further education training providers can offer part time or infil training to 14 and 15 year olds using standard 16-18 programme funding, provided that the learners are engaged in their primary study at school or home.
