TargetTag: "t levels"

T Levels are a new type of vocational training programme, designed to occupy the space between A Levels and Apprenticeships.

They are focused on providing core technical skills alongside comprehensive work experience, tailored to specific job roles (in this regard they work alongside the new apprenticeship standards).

T Levels require two years to complete, and must include a nine-week industry placement (315 hours total).

Just like 16-19 study programmes they are funded based on the number of planned hours, but use an extended version of the funding bands.
