      <description>Oh boy, apprenticeship funding is confusing.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea, which I stole from the technical funding guide that the ESFA published.

The training provider agrees a TNP (Total Negotiated Price) of £15,000 with the employer because&amp;hellip; well sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s the way things go.</description>
