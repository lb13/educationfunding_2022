      <h2>How Does Apprenticeship Funding Work?</h2>
      <p>Oh boy, apprenticeship funding is confusing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the basic idea, which I stole from the technical funding guide that the ESFA published.</p>
<h2 id="the-scenario">The scenario</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we have a <strong>12 month</strong> apprenticeship with a funding cap of <strong>£12,000</strong>. That cap is there because the ESFA don&rsquo;t think it should cost any more than that to deliver the apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The training provider agrees a TNP (Total Negotiated Price) of <strong>£15,000</strong> with the employer because&hellip; well sometimes that&rsquo;s the way things go.</p>
<h2 id="the-funding-cap">The funding cap</h2>
<p>The first thing that the ESFA will do is slice off anything above the funding cap - they&rsquo;re not interested in that at all.</p>
<p>In this case, that&rsquo;s <strong>£3,000</strong>, and the employer will have to pay it themselves - they can&rsquo;t use their levy funds even if they have some spare. Cash or card thank you.</p>
<p>So that leaves us with <strong>£12,000</strong> to pay to the training provider. Let&rsquo;s call this the capped TNP (this capping wouldn&rsquo;t need to happen if the TNP was less than the funding cap, in that case we&rsquo;d just take the TNP as it is).</p>
<h2 id="the-completion-payment">The completion payment</h2>
<p>The next thing that the ESFA will do is chop <strong>20%</strong> off the capped TNP and put it to one side - this is the <strong>completion payment</strong>.</p>
<p>The ESFA will only release this money if the apprentice <em>completes</em> all their learning and enters End Point Assessment. They don&rsquo;t have to achieve, but they do need to complete.</p>
<p>In our example, the completion payment is <strong>£2,400</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="on-programme-payments">On programme payments</h2>
<p>Next, the ESFA will take the remaining 80% of the capped TNP (80% of £12,000 is £9,600) and divide it over the number of planned study months.</p>
<p>Our example apprenticeship runs for <strong>12 months</strong>, so we&rsquo;ll do £9,600 divided by 12, which gives us a monthly on programme payment of <strong>£800</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="who-pays">Who pays?</h2>
<p>The last question is: who pays?</p>
<p>There are two different payment mechanisms that can be used - <strong>levy payments</strong> and <strong>co-investment</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="levy-payments">Levy payments</h3>
<p>For businesses that have a levy account, they can use the money in their account to pay the monthly on programme costs to the training provider.</p>
<h3 id="co-investment">Co-investment</h3>
<p>For businesses that either don&rsquo;t have enough in their account, or just don&rsquo;t use the levy system at all, the ESFA will cover <em>most</em> of the cost each month. They still expect the employer to pay something, and for recent apprenticeships this is 5% of the total (older apprenticeships required a 10% payment from the employer).</p>
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked example</h2>
<p>The tables below demonstrate how this plays out for three different employers.</p>
