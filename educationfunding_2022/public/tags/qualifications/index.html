      <h2>How to Find Qualifications</h2>
      <p>There are a few different online services that you can use to search for qualifications, find out whether they are eligible for ESFA funding, and connect with awarding bodies.</p>
<p>One quick way to search for these from the front page of <a href="/">EducationFunding.UK</a> is to type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fqs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - this is a shortcode for &lsquo;find qualification services&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-learning-aim">Find a Learning Aim</h2>
<p>This is a new government service which you can use to search for qualifications via their name or aim reference - in addition you can also filter results by level and awarding body.</p>
<p>The information provided for each learning aim is essential when determining whether funding is available.</p>
<p><a href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/">https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/</a></p>
<h2 id="ofqual-register-of-regulated-qualifications">Ofqual Register of Regulated Qualifications</h2>
<p>This is an online service provided by Ofqual, which offers similar search functions to &lsquo;Find a Learning Aim&rsquo; but gives you more information about the delivery of the qualification. You can filter your search results by a far wider range of options - including subject area, awarding body, level, and number of credits.</p>
<p>Each qualification listing will also provide details about the GLH and TQT, and usually includes a link to the specification on the awarding body&rsquo;s website. It does not provide funding information.</p>
<p><a href="https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/">https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/</a></p>
<h2 id="esfa-list-of-qualifications-approved-for-funding">ESFA List of Qualifications approved for funding</h2>
<p>This is a more restricted list, which only contains qualifications currently approved for funding. It offers similar search and filtering options to both &lsquo;Find a Learning Aim&rsquo; and Ofqual&rsquo;s &lsquo;Register of Regulated Qualifications&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It does not provide the level of detail found in either of the other services, but can be helpful when searching for valid qualifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk">https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk</a></p>
<h2 id="awarding-bodies">Awarding bodies</h2>
<p>You can find a list of commonly used awarding bodies here.</p>
<p><a href="https://educationfunding.uk/tags/awarding-bodies">https://educationfunding.uk/tags/awarding-bodies</a></p>
<h2 id="which-service-to-use">Which service to use?</h2>
<p>Depending on your goal, you could start with any of these services - but they will all offer useful information about a qualification, and should be used together where possible.</p>
