      <description>The National Skills Fund is a new funding option within the Adult Education Budget, which offers learners aged 19+ the opportunity to claim full funding for their first full level 3 qualification. Unlike the Level 3 Legal Entitlement, there is no upper age limit.
Only a targeted selection of qualifications fall into the NSF, these are aims that the ESFA believes will ‘&amp;hellip;help adults to train and gain the valuable skills they need to improve their job prospects.</description>

      <title>How Does Apprenticeship Funding Work?</title>

      <description>Oh boy, apprenticeship funding is confusing.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea, which I stole from the technical funding guide that the ESFA published.
The scenario Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine we have a 12 month apprenticeship with a funding cap of £12,000. That cap is there because the ESFA don&amp;rsquo;t think it should cost any more than that to deliver the apprenticeship.
The training provider agrees a TNP (Total Negotiated Price) of £15,000 with the employer because&amp;hellip; well sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s the way things go.</description>

      <description>Welp, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.
Life has been a tad busy, so I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to keep on top of this as much as I would have liked to.
I&amp;rsquo;ve redesigned the appearance a little, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s easy on the eyes. I&amp;rsquo;ve also adjusted the main page so that it provides quick links to the main funding areas - I might keep working on this depending on how well it works.</description>

      <description>Hello again!
The new site has been running for a few weeks now, and feedback has been good about the core concept and functionality.
Some users rightly pointed out that the design was too close to that used for official government services, and despite the disclaimers dotted around the site, was liable to cause confusion and mislead people.
This was certainly not my intention - rather I wanted to provide a seamless experience when navigating between different resources - but I can see that it was a little too close for comfort.</description>

      <title>How to Find Qualifications</title>

      <description>There are a few different online services that you can use to search for qualifications, find out whether they are eligible for ESFA funding, and connect with awarding bodies.
One quick way to search for these from the front page of EducationFunding.UK is to type fqs - this is a shortcode for &amp;lsquo;find qualification services&amp;rsquo;.
Find a Learning Aim This is a new government service which you can use to search for qualifications via their name or aim reference - in addition you can also filter results by level and awarding body.</description>

      <description>Hello, this is a quick post to say hello!
After working in the field of education funding for several years, I have amassed a prodigious list of bookmarks - and every year the list grows as more resources are published, new organisations emerge, and new web services are developed.
It was becoming tricky to keep track of all these links, and trickier still to make them available to colleagues in a simple and straightforward way.</description>
